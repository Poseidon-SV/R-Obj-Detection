# R. Obj. Detection
### Realtime Object Detection (R. Obj. Detection) is a product of Tech Que Club

In this project we are going to build a program which will detect object in real time using camera or from user intput images, with the help of Open CV, Deep learning and Sk-learn libraries. We'll use PyQt6 for building our GUI to intract with our program.

## Getting Started 

__Step 1__: Install __Open CV__ in your environment by typing `pip install opencv` in your terminal.

__Step 2__: Install __SK-learn__ library by typing `pip install sklearn` in your terminal.

__Step 3__: Install __PyQt6__ and __PyQt6 tools__ for building GUI by typing this in terminal.
```
pip install pyqt6
pip install pyqt6-tools
```

__Step 4__: Learn about OpenCV, Sk-learn, PyQt6 and Deep learning in python.

__Step 5__: Make a project on each topic to get hands-on experience.
